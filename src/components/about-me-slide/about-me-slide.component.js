            &emsp;Hi there! I'd like to tell you bit about myself. My name is
            Quinn and I am currently studying Computer Engineering at the
            University of Waterloo. As part of my studies at uWaterloo, I have
            had the opportunity to work on some incredible teams, including the
            teams at HelloGbye and SnapTravel. While working with these teams, I
            have been able to contribute to some interesting products that are
            pushing the travel industry into a brand-new technological era.
            Moving forward, Iâ€™m excited to continue to work on innovative and
            cutting edge technologies.
